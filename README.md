### Hi there, I'm Kabilan 👋

#### Software Engineer @ DEP (5.5 Yrs) | CAE & HPC Specialist
**Bridging Physics & Real-Time Systems with Modern C++20, OpenGL, and Intel TBB.**

---

### 👨‍💻 About Me
I am a **CAE Software Engineer** specializing in the architecture of high-performance geometry kernels and simulation pipelines. My core expertise lies in modernizing legacy engineering tools using **Modern C++ (RAII, Move Semantics)** and accelerating solvers using **Parallel Algorithms (TBB)**.

I am deeply interested in the intersection of **Physical Simulation, GPU Architecture, and low-level memory management**. I recently built a custom Voxel Engine to explore dense-grid rendering, cache locality, and real-time performance.

* 🔭 **Current Focus:** Transitioning into a dedicated **"Solver Sprint"** to architect advanced physics and math solvers for high-performance simulations.
* ⚡ **Impact:** Reduced legacy solver memory footprint by **200MB** via C++17 optimization and achieved **180+ FPS** in custom volumetric rendering.
* 🧠 **Domain:** Computational Geometry, Real-Time Rendering (OpenGL), Finite Element Analysis (FEA), and CSR Solvers.
